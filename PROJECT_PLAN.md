## Recently Completed

**Phase 6.5: Cache Statistics** (2025-10-25)
- Added `table_cache_stats()` API method
- Integrated cache statistics in db_bench
- Block cache: 90.94% hit rate | Table cache: ~100% hit rate
- Full visibility into cache performance

**Phase 6.4: Compaction Stress Tests**
- 6 comprehensive stress tests (concurrent writes, large datasets, mixed ops)
- Fixed concurrent compaction race condition
- Validated compaction behavior under stress

**Phase 6.1-6.3: Compaction Infrastructure**
- Dynamic level sizing with priority-based scoring
- Per-level statistics & read/write amplification tracking
- Subcompaction planner for parallel execution infrastructure

---

## Current Status

**Core Features**: All complete ✅
- LSM-Tree (WAL, MemTable, SSTable, Compaction, MANIFEST)
- Column Families, Iterators, Transactions, Checkpoint, Statistics

**Performance**: Production-ready ✅
- 104K writes/sec, 4.3K random reads/sec, 808K seq reads/sec
- Optimized caching (Block/Table Cache with 90%+ hit rates)
- Bloom filters, Compression (Snappy/LZ4)

**Quality**: Comprehensive ✅
- 239 tests (unit, integration, stress, property-based, crash recovery)
- 2,287 LOC documentation
- All CI passing (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows × stable/nightly)

## Next Options

**Option A: Universal Compaction**
- Alternative strategy for write-heavy workloads
- Fewer levels, larger files, different space/write amplification trade-off

**Option B: Advanced Testing**
- Fuzzing, long-running stress tests, Jepsen-style testing
- Property-based testing expansion

**Option C: Performance & I/O**
- Async I/O, parallel compaction execution
- Write batching API improvements

**Option D: Advanced Features**
- Backup engine, SST import/export, TTL support
- Rate limiting, write throttling
