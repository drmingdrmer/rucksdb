## Recently Completed

**Phase 12: Property-Based Testing** (2025-10-26)
- Implemented comprehensive property-based testing with proptest
- 10 property tests covering core database invariants:
  - Write-Read Consistency (duplicate key handling with HashMap)
  - Delete Semantics (deleted keys return None)
  - Overwrite Semantics (last write wins)
  - Persistence (data survives restart, with duplicate key handling)
  - Operation Determinism (model-based testing with HashMap reference)
  - Empty Value Handling
  - Large Value Handling (10KB-100KB)
  - Key Ordering Invariant (iterator returns sorted keys)
  - Read-Your-Writes Consistency
  - Compaction Preserves Data (with duplicate key handling)
- All 10 property tests passing with 100+ test cases each
- Fixed iterator API usage and borrowing lifetime issues
- Tests verify correctness under random inputs (1-100 operations per test)

**Phase 11: Merge Operator** (2025-10-25)
- `MergeOperator` trait with `full_merge()` and `partial_merge()` methods
- `CounterMerge` - built-in integer counter with addition/subtraction
- `StringAppendMerge` - built-in string concatenation with configurable delimiter
- `WriteOp::Merge` variant for WriteBatch integration
- `WriteBatch::merge()` API for batching merge operations
- DBOptions integration with optional merge operator configuration
- 9 comprehensive tests (counter/string operators, partial merge, negative values)

**Phase 10: SST File Ingestion - DB Integration** (2025-10-25)
- `ingest_external_file()` - DB API for ingesting external SST files
- `ingest_external_file_cf()` - column family-specific ingestion
- LSM tree integration via VersionEdit and log_and_apply
- File number allocation through VersionSet
- 2 comprehensive integration tests (copy mode, move mode with full data verification)
- Total 6 tests in import_export module, all passing

**Phase 9: SST File Import/Export - Foundation** (2025-10-25)
- `validate_external_file()` - validates SST file structure and extracts metadata
- `copy_external_file()` - copies/moves SST files with parent directory creation
- `IngestExternalFileOptions` - configuration for file ingestion
- `ExternalFileInfo` - file metadata (size, entries, key range)
- 4 foundation tests (validate, copy, move, error handling)

**Phase 8: Backup & Restore Engine** (2025-10-25)
- `BackupEngine` - comprehensive backup management system
- `create_backup()` - create backups with hard-link optimization
- `restore_backup()` - restore backups to target directory
- `list_backups()` and `delete_backup()` - backup lifecycle management
- JSON metadata tracking for SST, WAL, and MANIFEST files
- 3 comprehensive tests (backup/restore, multiple backups, deletion)

**Phase 7: Manual Compaction & Properties** (2025-10-25)
- `compact_range()` and `compact_range_cf()` - manual compaction control
- `get_property()` - query database properties (files per level, total size, stats)
- 5 new tests for manual compaction and properties
- Updated db_bench to display database properties and statistics

**Phase 6: Compaction Enhancements** (2025-10-25)
- Dynamic level sizing with priority-based scoring
- Per-level statistics & read/write amplification tracking
- Subcompaction planner for parallel execution infrastructure
- 6 comprehensive stress tests (concurrent writes, large datasets, mixed ops)
- Cache statistics: Block cache 90.94% hit rate | Table cache ~100% hit rate

## Next Options

**Option A: Universal Compaction**
- Alternative strategy for write-heavy workloads
- Fewer levels, larger files, different space/write amplification trade-off

**Option B: Advanced Testing** (Partially completed ✅)
- ✅ Property-based testing with proptest (10 tests)
- TODO: Fuzzing, long-running stress tests, Jepsen-style testing

**Option C: Performance & I/O**
