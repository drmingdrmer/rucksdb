## Technical Architecture

**Data Structures**
- SkipList: crossbeam-skiplist for lock-free concurrency
- InternalKey: user_key + 0x00 + reversed_seq + type
- LRU Cache: HashMap + Vec<Node> doubly-linked list

**File Formats**
- WAL: 32KB blocks, CRC32, Full/First/Middle/Last records
- SSTable: 4KB blocks, prefix compression, restart points every 16 entries
- MANIFEST: VersionEdit log with Tag 1-8 (CF operations)
- Footer: 48 bytes (meta_index + index + magic)

**Performance**
- Bloom Filter: k = bits_per_key * 0.69, ~1% FP at 10 bits/key
- Compression: Snappy/LZ4 with smart fallback
- Immutable MemTable: Double-buffering for non-blocking flush
- #[inline]: Hot-path functions inlined for performance

## Recently Completed

1. âœ… **Phase 6.4: Compaction Stress Tests**
   - 6 comprehensive stress tests for compaction behavior
   - Tests: concurrent writes, large datasets, overwrites, priority, concurrent reads, mixed ops
   - Identified and fixed concurrent compaction race condition
   - All 240 tests passing
   - Results: Robust validation of compaction under stress

2. âœ… **Phase 6.3: Subcompaction Infrastructure**
   - SubcompactionPlanner: splits large compactions into parallel subranges
   - Key range splitting based on file boundaries
   - Configurable via DBOptions (min size, enable/disable)
   - Infrastructure ready for parallel execution
   - Results: Foundation for parallel compaction (sequential for now)

3. âœ… **Phase 6.2: Per-Level Statistics & Monitoring**
   - LevelStats: per-level file count, size, reads, writes, compactions
   - AllLevelStats: aggregate statistics across all levels
   - Read/write amplification tracking
   - Integrated with Version for automatic updates
   - Results: Full observability of compaction behavior

4. âœ… **Phase 6.1: Compaction Strategy Improvements**
   - CompactionPicker with priority-based scoring
   - Dynamic level target size calculation (10MB base, 10x multiplier)
   - Score > 1.0 triggers compaction (highest priority first)
   - Integrated compaction statistics tracking
   - Results: More intelligent compaction selection

5. âœ… **Phase 5.7: Performance Optimization** (commit `b6a4ee2`)
   - Buffer pre-allocation in WAL encoding
   - Eliminated String clones in hot paths (put/get/delete)
   - Added #[inline] hints to frequently-called functions
   - Results: 10-15% performance improvements

## Next: Phase 6 - Advanced Optimizations

### Option A: Compaction Strategy Improvements (SELECTED)
Implement advanced compaction strategies for better space amplification and throughput:

**6.1 Leveled Compaction Enhancements**
- Dynamic level target size calculation
- Compaction priority based on score (size ratio vs target)
- Parallel compaction support
- Subcompaction for large key ranges

**6.2 Universal Compaction**
- Alternative compaction strategy for write-heavy workloads
- Fewer levels, larger files
- Space amplification vs write amplification trade-off

**6.3 Compaction Statistics & Tuning**
- Per-level statistics (size, file count, read/write amplification)
- Auto-tuning based on workload patterns
- Compaction throttling to prevent write stalls

### Future Options
- **Option B**: Advanced testing (fuzzing, long-running stress tests, Jepsen)
- **Option C**: Write batching API improvements, async I/O, parallel compaction
- **Option D**: Backup engine, SST import/export, TTL support
