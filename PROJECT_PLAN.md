- **SkipList**: Use `crossbeam-skiplist` for lock-free concurrent access
- **InternalKey encoding**: Add 0x00 separator to prevent key prefix issues
- **Sequence encoding**: Use `u64::MAX - sequence` for descending order
- **Concurrency**: Use `parking_lot::RwLock` for better performance

### 2025-10-23 - Phase 2.1 WAL
- **WAL Format**: 32KB blocks with CRC32 checksums, support record fragmentation
- **Record Types**: Full, First, Middle, Last for handling large records
- **Recovery**: Read all WAL records on DB open and rebuild MemTable
- **Testing**: Use `tempfile::TempDir` to avoid test pollution
